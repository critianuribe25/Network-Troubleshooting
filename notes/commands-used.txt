# 🧾 Commands Used

Below is a breakdown of each network troubleshooting command used in this project, including its purpose and what the output reveals.

---

## 1. `ipconfig`
**Purpose:**  
Displays the computer’s IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS configuration.

**What I learned:**  
- Shows local network settings  
- Confirms whether the device has a valid IP address  
- Helps identify gateway for connectivity tests  

---

## 2. `ping google.com`
**Purpose:**  
Tests if the computer can reach an external host and measures latency.

**What I learned:**  
- Successful replies mean the device has internet access  
- Round trip times indicate connection quality  
- Packet loss would suggest a network problem

## 3. `tracert google.com`
**Purpose:**  
Shows the route packets take from the local computer to a destination server.

**What I learned:**  
- Identifies which hop (router/server) may be causing delays  
- Reveals how many networks the request passes through  
- Timeouts are normal on secured hops  

---

## 4. `nslookup google.com`
**Purpose:**  
Queries the DNS server to resolve a domain name into an IP address.

**What I learned:**  
- Confirms DNS is working  
- Shows the DNS server being used  
- Provides IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the domain
